## Vulnerability Detection

Hack Hound employs various techniques to detect vulnerabilities:
- **XSS**: Identifies potential XSS vulnerabilities by analyzing input fields and URL parameters.
- **SQL Injection**: Checks for SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting SQL queries into input fields.
- **Path Traversal**: Detects path traversal vulnerabilities by attempting to access restricted files or directories.
- **CSRF**: Identifies CSRF vulnerabilities by analyzing form submission and request patterns.
- **SSRF**: Detects SSRF vulnerabilities by analyzing server responses and URL redirections.
- **Command Injection**: Checks for command injection vulnerabilities by injecting shell commands into input fields.
